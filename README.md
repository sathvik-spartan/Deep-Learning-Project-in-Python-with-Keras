# Deep-Learning-Project-in-Python-with-Keras

## üß† Pima Diabetes Neural Network Classifier

A simple neural network built using TensorFlow/Keras to classify the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**.  
This project is inspired by the [Machine Learning Mastery tutorial](https://machinelearningmastery.com/tutorial-first-neural-network-python-keras/).

## üìù Description

This project demonstrates how to:
- Load and preprocess a CSV dataset.
- Build a basic feedforward neural network using Keras (TensorFlow backend).
- Train, evaluate, and predict using the model.
- Use train-test split and measure performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
